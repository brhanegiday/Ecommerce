      "The Samsung Galaxy S series and the Galaxy Note series smartphones have always been prime examples of what high-end Android smartphones are capable of. These devices are highly sought after and have always commanded a premium over what the other brands have on offer. Now, in order to compete better with brands such as OnePlus, and to lower the entry point for the Galaxy S and Galaxy Note series, Samsung has launched the Galaxy S10 Lite and Galaxy Note 10 Lite. These new smartphones are priced at around Rs. 40,000 which is significantly lower than their respective non-lite versions.",

      "The Samsung Galaxy A70 is being marketed as a multimedia powerhouse that can also deliver good photography results with its triple rear cameras and offer a smooth performance. The Samsung phone packs a beautiful 6.7-inch full-HD+ (1080x2400 pixels) Super AMOLED display which is vibrant, has good viewing angles and great sunlight legibility, making it a great choice for watching videos and playing games.The phone is powered by the Snapdragon 675 processor paired with 6GB of RAM. The Galaxy A70 handles day-to-day tasks and gaming with ease, and the phone also does not heat up during intensive tasks. The Galaxy A70 also comes with Dolby Atmos support, but the in-display fingerprint sensor is a little slow at recognition.The triple rear cameras help the Galaxy A70 capture crisp photos with good edge details and decent dynamic range. However, the camera struggles to reproduce true colours under harsh daylight and there is also some softening at the periphery. But the phone lacks EIS and OIS support, but the slow-mo videos turned out very smooth. The Galaxy A70 packs a 4,500mAh battery which easily lasts through a full day of heavy usage, while the bundled Super Fast Charging adapter takes the battery from 0-100 in less than two hours.",

    info:
      "The Redmi Note 8 should make smartphone buyers on a tight budget very happy. It doesn't look very slick, with a thick chin below its 6.3-inch screen, but you get a choice of gradients for the back, and there's a matching highlight colour around the bottom of the front face. The front and back are both Gorilla Glass 5, and there's an anti-splash coating which are both great for the budget segment. You get a Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 SoC with either 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, or 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The full-HD+ resolution, 4000mAh battery and 48-megapixel main rear camera are also great features considering the price of this phone. Performance is very good, though gaming wasn't perfectly smooth. The cameras and battery life are good, but not spectacular. Overall, Xiaomi continues to offer excellent value for money.",

      "The Galaxy S10e is the smallest and lightest of the three new Galaxy S10 models at 150g. It feels incredibly comfortable to hold and the rounded edges aren't abrasive on the skin. The aluminium and glass back is a bit slippery when used with one hand, and this phone does attract fingerprints easily.The Samsung Galaxy S10e has a 5.8-inch full-HD+ Dynamic AMOLED display, with HDR 10+ certification. At the back of the phone, we noticed some more cutbacks compared to other Galaxy S10 models. It ditches the telephoto camera so you only get the main dual-aperture, 12-megapixel sensor and the 16-megapixel ultra-wide angle one.It has the Exynos 9820 octa-core SoC, alogn with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The Galaxy S10e also features AKG-tuned stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos, an IP68 certification for dust and water resistance, and a whole bunch of sensors.General app and UI performance is great. Games ran very well, even high-end ones such as PUBG Mobile. Thanks to the powerful SoC and lower screen resolution, the Galaxy S10e easily managed to drive them at the highest settings. The Galaxy S10e has a 3100mAh battery, which is the smallest of the series, and that has a noticeable effect in everyday use. We typically managed to get roughly 17 to 18 hours of actual battery life.",
